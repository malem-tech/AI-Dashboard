# AI-Dashboard
During the period of the Internship given by HighRadius, we were assigned to make a 
project with the use of skills acquired during the internship such as React JS, Google 
Diagflow, JavaScript, ML etc using Visual Studios and SQL database. The product was 
an Artificial Intelligent Dashboard which took in data and with the help of an AI bot 
called “Freeda” which guided the course of action and as a result we could predict 
the partial payment by using a ML model best suited for the data that has been used.
Below is the Mainframe of the Dashboard and the AI bot.
